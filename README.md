# Marshalling-ReactNative
This is a demo application for Marshalling at https://github.com/MarshalPaterson/Marshalling 

Please note that Marshalling and the example are written in Typescript it is important that your project can render tsc. A good article can be read at https://medium.com/@rintoj/react-native-with-typescript-40355a90a5d7

Though if you are not using Typescript you can still reference Marshalling in a normal ES6 Javascript project.

```git clone https://github.com/MarshalPaterson/Marshalling-ReactNative```

```npm install```

```npm run build```

```react-native run-ios``` or ```react-native run-android```
